The C code for the interface is generated using SWIG, but SWIG is not
required for building/installing it.  (To regenerate the wrapper from the
SWIG source, use "swig -python pisock.i".)

There is currently no documentation; that should be fixed soon.


INSTALLATION

This package uses the standard Python "distutils" for installation. If you
are running a version of Python >= 2.0 you have these already; for Python
1.5.2 you can download a distutils package from python.org. If you want to
build it for a Python version older than 1.5.2, you are on your own; it
probably won't work anyway.

To compile the package, run the command

    python setup.py build

You may safely ignore any warnings from the compiler.

To install the package, run the command

    python setup.py install

It will place a module called 'pisock.so' in Python's site-packages
directory.  To use the module, simply 'import pisock'.


STANDALONE VERSION

You can also build a standalone version that doesn't require the libpisock
library to be installed on the system. This is particularly useful if you
need to build a self-package application that doesn't depend on additional
installs. To build the standalone verison, run the command

	python setup-standalone.py build


MULTIPLE PYTHON INSTALLS

Note: If you have more than one version of Python installed, replace
'python' in the above commands with the name of the interpreter you want to
use for building and installation.  (For example, 'python2' for Python 2.x
on some Linux distributions.) If you want to build/install for multiple
versions of Python, just repeat the above steps for each one.
