This is an (functional yet still experimental) piece of code to interface
Perl 5 to the pilot-link library. To use it, you will need to perform these
steps:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make

If everything is working, you can execute a "make test". If that proves
successful, execute a "make install UNINST=1" as root to install this
interface system-wide.

	make test
	make install UNINST=1

For additional documentation, please read test.pl.
