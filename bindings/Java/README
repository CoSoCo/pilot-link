Pilot-Link Java-Bindings
Consider this Code PRE-Alpha! Use at own risk!

I wrote this new version of Java because i could not get the original one by
David Goodenough to work with the new Java VM 1.4. I used a different
apporach to the problem:

- I tried to keep the C-part as small as possible for two reasons, 1st I
  wanted to be able to expand the functionality to other datatypes (like
  mileage, images etc.) in java without running a c-compiler! This makes it
  more easy to keep it platform independent; and 2nd, I coded my last C
  program several years ago ;-)

- All the communication with the pilot-link interface is done by one class,
  org.gnu.pilotlink.PilotLink which calls the c-functions. There, raw
  records are used (org.gnu.pilotlink.RawRecord) which can then be
  transformed to other types of records (memo, datebookrecord etc. - analog
  to streams in java), e.g.:

    DatebookRecord dr=new DatebookRecord(PilotLink.getRecord...)


Things the java-bindings can do now (not much, I know...):
- Read raw records, write raw records
- read in datebook entries
- write datebook entries
- read user and sys info

More functionality will follow as soon as possible...

There is a problem with opening more than one db in one session, even if
closing before. I'm working on it...

INSTALL

Normally you install it by following these steps:

1) Edit the Makefile and change the path to JAVA_HOME according to your
   jdk-installation, set PORT to your Pilot-Port

2) Run "make"
3) As root do: "make install"

4) Test the installation with: java test

The testfile should establish a connection to your palm and read out some
records. You can test storing as well by editinng the test.java accordingly.

If you have suggestions or questions, drop me a line.
