Sorry for not providing decent information here. The basics are:
  
  1) run configure (unless using OS/2)
    
  2) run make (unless using OS/2, then make -f Makefile.os2)
    
  3) play around, _carefully_. pilot-xfer is probably the most useful
     program for you, and also the safest.

Happy Hacking,
