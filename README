Sorry for not providing decent information here. The basics are:

 For UNIX and Win32/Cygwin:
 -------------------------  
	1) Run configure. If you want to install in someplace other than
	   /usr/local, give configure an argument like '--prefix=/usr/pilot'
	
	2) Run make
	
	3) Play around, CAREFULLY. pilot-xfer is probably the most useful
	   program for you, and also the safest of all to use
	   non-destructively. Also dlpsh is a good app to use to poke around
	   in your Palm device.
	
	4) Run 'make install' if you you have tested thoroughly and are sure
	   pilot-link works well for you.

 For OS/2:
 --------  
	1) Run os2configure.cmd.
	
	2) Run make -f Makefile.os2
	
	3) Play around, CAREFULLY. pilot-xfer is probably the most useful
	   program for you, and also the safest of all to use
	   non-destructively. Also dlpsh is a good app to use to poke around
	   in your Palm device.
	
	4) Run 'make install' if you you have tested thoroughly and are sure
	   pilot-link works well for you.
	
	Note on pilot-debug: this program is a work-in-progress, and
	requires Tcl 7.5 (or greater) and optionally Tk 4.1 (or greater)
	and/or Readline 2.0.  You'll need to modify Makefile to to use
	Readline 2.0, and if your Tcl or Tk aren't in standard places,
	you'll need to wiggle configure or the Makefile.  You must have
	install pilot-link or else run pilot-debug in the pilot-link source
	directory if you want the fancy images for the Remote UI window.


Usage notes:
-----------
	read-ical and sync-ical will only run if you have ical-2.x installed
	and in the path.
	
	sync-plan is a full syncronization program, though it has some
	interesting quirks and requirements. You must running netplan from
	plan-1.6.1 (probably available at
	<http://www.in-berlin.de/User/bitrot>). Future or later versions may
	work, but I cannot gaurantee this. Sync-plan does _not_ check the
	Palm's user name, so be very careful not to sync two Palms to the
	same Plan database. This will not work in a useful manner, at the
	moment. Sync-plan leaves a file, that has a name starting with
	"pilothash", in the current directory. This file must be present for
	all future syncs between that plan database and that Palm.
	
	As sync-plan is a work in progress, please contact me with any
	problems.
	
	The default connection rate is 9600 baud. You are welcome to try
	higher baud rates (19200, 38400, or 57600) by setting the PILOTRATE
	environment variable, but various machines have various limitations.
	(Be careful about 38400 on a Linux box if you've been using
	setserial to change the multiplier.)
	
	pilot-mail (which requires a Palm with the new Mail application, as
	well as sendmail and/or a POP3 server) is still in the experimental
	stage.  Run with an argument of '-H' for help. While I don't expect
	it to lose data, (and by default mail is kept on both sides, not
	deleted) I can not and will not guarantee that you won't. Please
	back up your UNIX mailbox and Palm mailbox (via pilot-xfer) before
	experimenting.
	
	If you wish, you may easily change the default settings (pop host,
	password, etc.) for pilot-mail by editing the top of pilot-mail.c,
	as well as by setting the environment variables indicated in its
	help.
	
	Scott Grosch's "validate" program is included, and can be made via
	'make validate', but it may not be of use to anyone but Scott.

Debugging notes:
---------------
	Please see doc/README.debugging for more detailed information.
	
Embedding information:
---------------------
	As of 0.5.0, the headers in pilot-link have been rearranged slightly
	so that it should be easier and more reliable to use the libpisock.a
	library in external applications.
	
	If you want to use the pilot-link portability layer (configured via
	autoconf), then include pi-source.h. Otherwise, do not touch this
	file, as it sets up a mildly complex environment.
	
	For all normal operations, simply include the obvious files (pi-file
	for pdb and .prc file access, pi-dlp for DLP sync functions, etc.). 
	pi-macros contains the portable byte-access routines.

Reporting Bugs:
--------------
	Any bugs you find with pilot-link can be easily reported in the
	online bug tracking system at http://bugs.pilot-link.org, and can be
	updated, audited, commented on, and resovled from there.
	
	Please check the existing bugs in the system first before reporting
	your bug. There may be an identical report from another user that
	matches your bug.
