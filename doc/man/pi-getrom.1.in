.SH "NAME"
\fBpi\-getrom\fR \- Retrieves the ROM image from your Palm device for use in 
debugging.


.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBpi\-getrom\fR [\fB\-p\fR <\fIport\fR>] [\fIfilename\fR]


.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBpi\-getrom\fR is used to fetch the ROM from your Palm handheld for use in
debugging Palm applications through the use of POSE, the \fIPalm OS Emulator
application\fR. 

Note, because \fBpi\-getrom\fR uses the low-level RPC protocol to fetch the
ROM image, and the new OS5 devices do not use this protocol, you currently
cannot fetch an OS5 ROM image using this utility. This will be updated in a
future release to handle fetching OS5 ROM images, using the debugger
protocol.


.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-port\fR <\fIport\fR>
Use device file <\fIport\fR> to communicate with the Palm handheld. If this
is not specified, will look for the \fI$PILOTPORT\fR environment variable.
If both are not found or supplied, \fBpi\-getrom\fR will fall back to
/dev/pilot.
   
   
.TP 
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display the help synopsis for \fBpi\-getrom\fR.


.TP 
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Display version of \fBpi\-getrom\fR.


.TP 
<\fIfilename\fR>
Write the ROM image to the file named by <\fIfilename\fR>. If this is
omitted, the filename will be written out as the rom version name as
follows: 'pilot-$VERSION.rom', where an OS 3.5 image would be written as the
filename of 'pilot-3.5.0.rom'.


.SH "USAGE"
Connect to a target Palm handheld and fetch the ROM for use in debugging
Palm applications through the use of POSE, the \fIPalm OS Emulator\fR or
with the \fICoPilot\fR application (deprecated).

.SH "BUGS"
.PP
\fBKNOWN BUGS\fR
.IP
\fBpi\-getrom\fR does not work with OS5 devices as yet, due to changes in
the architecture and design of the Palm HotSync protocol and file type
changes from m68k to ARM. Other than that, \fBpi\-getrom\fR has no known
bugs at this time.
