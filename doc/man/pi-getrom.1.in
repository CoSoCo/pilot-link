.SH "NAME"
\fBpi\-getrom\fR \- Retrieves a ROM image or sysem information from your Palm device.


.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBpi\-getrom\fR [\fIcommon\-options\fR] [\fB\-\-rom\fR] <\fIfilename\fR>

\fBpi\-getrom\fR [\fIcommon\-options\fR] \fB\-\-sysinfo\fR


.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBpi\-getrom\fR is used to fetch the ROM from your Palm handheld for use in
debugging Palm applications through the use of POSE, the \fIPalm OS Emulator
application\fR. 


.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 
See \fBpilot-link\fR(7) for details on the common options.

.TP
\fB\-\-rom\fR
Read the ROM image. This is the default.

.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sysinfo\fR
Read the system information instead of retrieving a ROM image.

.TP 
<\fIfilename\fR>
Write the ROM image to the file named by <\fIfilename\fR>. If this is
omitted, the filename will be written out as the rom version name as
follows: 'pilot-$VERSION.rom', where an OS 3.5 image would be written as the
filename of 'pilot-3.5.0.rom'.


.SH "USAGE"
(With \fB\-\-rom\fR) Connect to a target Palm handheld and fetch the ROM for use in debugging
Palm applications through the use of POSE, the \fIPalm OS Emulator\fR or
with the \fICoPilot\fR application (deprecated).

(With \fB\-\-sysinfo\fR) Connect to a target Palm handheld and print the system information
to standard output.

.SH "LICENSING"
\fBWarning\fR: Please completely back up your Palm before using this
program! The developers of \fIpilot-link\fR are not responsible for any data
loss that may occur from the use of this application.

Use of this program MAY place you in violation of your license agreement
with Palmsource, Inc. or other OEM partners. Please read your Palm
documentation (specifically the "Software License Agreement") before running
this program.

.SH "NOTES"

Note, because \fBpi\-getrom\fR uses the low-level RPC protocol to fetch the
ROM image, and the new OS5 devices do not use this protocol, you currently
cannot fetch an OS5 ROM image using this utility. This will be updated in a
future release to handle fetching OS5 ROM images, using the debugger
protocol.


.SH "BUGS"
.PP
\fBKNOWN BUGS\fR
.IP
\fBpi\-getrom\fR does not work with OS5 devices as yet, due to changes in
the architecture and design of the Palm HotSync protocol and file type
changes from m68k to ARM. Other than that, \fBpi\-getrom\fR has no known
bugs at this time.
