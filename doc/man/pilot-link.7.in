.TH pilot-link 7 "@VERSION@"
.SH NAME
pilot-link \- A suite of tools for communicating with Palm handhelds, such as those made by Palm, Handspring, Handera, TRGPro, Sony or other Palm Compatible Handheld PDA device. 
.SH SECTION
pilot-link: Overview
.SH DESCRIPTION
The pilot-link suite of tools contains a series of conduits,
libraries,
and language bindings for moving information to and from your Palm
device and
your desktop or server/workstation system, as well as across the
network.
.SH "TARGET DEVICE"
The /dev/pilot fallback has been removed in v0.12.
The environment variable \fB$PILOTPORT\fR
can be set in your shell, to save specifying the port each time. A
serial
device specified on the command-line will be used regardless of any
\fB$PILOTPORT\fR setting. If \fB$PILOTPORT\fR
is not set, and \fB\-p\fR is not supplied, all conduits in
\fIpilot-link\fR will print the usage information.
The default connection rate is 9600 baud. You are welcome to try
higher
baud rates (19200, 38400, 57600 or higher) by setting the
\fB$PILOTRATE\fR environment variable, but various
machines
have various limitations. (Be careful about values higher than
115200 on
older Linux boxes if you've been using setserial to change the
multiplier).
.SH CONDUITS
A complete list of conduits available from within the
\fIpilot-link\fR package as of the date of this
manpage. If you invoke any of the conduits from \fIpilot-link\fR with no
command-line arguments at all, the usage summary will be printed.
.PP
Note that there are widespread changes in this release - some
conduits
have been merged, a lot have had new options added and some options
have been
renamed or removed.
