.TH "PILOT-LINK" "7" "pilot-link - @VERSION@" "(c) FSF 1996-2004" "pilot-link suite"

.SH "NAME"
\fBpilot\-link\fR \- a suite of tools for communicating with Palm handhelds,
such as those made from \fIPalm\fR, \fIHandspring\fR, \fIHandera\fR,
\fITRGPro\fR, \fISony\fR or other Palm Compatible Handheld PDA device.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBpilot\-link\fR suite of tools contains a series of conduits,
libraries, and language bindings for moving information to and from your
Palm device and your desktop or server/workstation system, as well as across
the network.

.SH "TARGET DEVICE"
All of the \fBpilot\-link\fR programs will default to \fI/dev/pilot\fR as
the default device used to communicate with a Palm. In general, if the
environment variable \fI$PILOTPORT\fR is set in your shell, its value will
override this default. A serial device specified on the command\-line will
be used regardless of any \fI$PILOTPORT\fR setting. If \fI$PILOTPORT\fR is
not set, and -p is not supplied, any of the conduits in \fBpilot\-link\fR
will default to /dev/pilot.

The default connection rate is 9600 baud. You are welcome to try higher baud
rates (19200, 38400, 57600 or higher) by setting the \fI$PILOTRATE\fR
environment variable, but various machines have various limitations. (Be
careful about values higher than 115200 on older Linux boxes if you've been
using setserial to change the multiplier).

.SH "USAGE"
Here is a list of programs available from within the \fBpilot\-link\fR
package as of the date of this manpage.


.TP 
\fBaddresses\fR
dump the Palm Address book into a generic text\-output format.

.TP 
\fBdebugsh\fR

this must be running to accept Network HotSync(tm) connects.

.TP 
\fBpi\-getram\fR
program that retrieves the RAM image from Palm.

.TP 
\fBpi\-getrom\fR
program that retrieves a ROM image from Palm (without using getrom.prc).


.TP 
\fBpi\-getromtoken\fR
program that retrieves the ROM tokens from the Palm, such as the serial
number of the device, if available. Does not work on OS5 devices, currently.

.TP 
\fBpi\-nredir\fR
program that accepts connections and redirects them via the Network
HotSync(tm) protocol.

.TP 
\fBpi\-port\fR
experimental program to abstract the serial layer from pilot\-link.

.TP 
\fBpilot\-addresses\fR
import and export records from the Address Book (AddressDB.pdb) on your
Palm.

.TP

from Hollis Blanchard <\fIhollis@amulet.co.jp\fR>. Please see the \fICREDITS\fR
file for additional information on how to obtain this package.

.TP 
\fBpilot\-schlep\fR
stores a single file of any data type (such as .zip or .mp3) on the Palm or
retrieves one from the Palm.

.TP 
\fBpilot\-undelete\fR

.TP 
\fBread\-expenses\fR
export Palm expense database into a simple text format.

.TP 
\fBread\-ical\fR
export Palm Datebook and ToDo databases (DatebookDB.pdb and ToDoDB.pdb
respectively) into an Ical calendar (the ical application must be installed

.SH "MAILING LIST"
The original pilot\-unix mailing list has been taken offline, and is now
being hosted and maintained by David A. Desrosiers

.IP
The pilot\-unix mailing list is for discussion and "idea\-sharing" for those
interested in using your Palm handheld with UNIX systems. This includes
people who are interested in helping to develop tools to allow the Palm to
operate with UNIX and other POSIX systems, and possibly to develop an SDK
(Software Development Kit) for the Palm for Unix.
