.TH "PILOT-LINK" "7" "pilot-link - @VERSION@" "Free Software Foundation" ""
.SH "NAME"
\fBpilot\-link\fR \- a suite of tools for communicating with Palm handheld devices, such as
those made from \fIPalm\fR, \fIHandspring\fR, \fIHandera\fR, \fITRGPro\fR, \fISony\fR or other Palm Compatible Handheld PDA device

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBpilot\-link\fR suite of tools contains a series of conduits for moving information to and from your Palm device and your desktop or server/workstation system.

.SH "TARGET DEVICE"
All of the \fBpilot\-link\fR programs will default to .B /dev/pilot as the default device used to communicate with a Palm. In general, if the environment variable \fI$PILOTPORT\fR
is set, its value will override the default. A serial device specified on the command\-line will be used regardless of any \fI$PILOTPORT\fR setting.

The default connection rate is 9600 baud. You are welcome to try higher baud rates (19200, 38400, 57600 or higher) by setting the \fI$PILOTRATE\fR environment variable, but various machines have various limitations. (Be careful about values higher than 115200 on Linux boxes if you've been using setserial to change the multiplier.)

.SH "MAILING LIST"
The original pilot\-unix mailing list has been taken offline, and is now being hosted and maintained by David A. Desrosiers <\fIdesrod@gnu\-designs.com\fP>. The original pilot\-unix mailing list was maintained by Matthew Cravit. Its mandate is:

The pilot\-unix mailing list is for discussion and idea\-sharing for those interested in using your Palm PDA with UNIX systems. This includes people who are interested in helping to develop tools to allow the Palm to operate with UNIX, and possibly to develop an SDK for the Palm for Unix.

For more information, including how to subscribe to the list, please visit
