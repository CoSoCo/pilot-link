.SH "NAME"
\fBread\-ical\fR \- coverts information on your Palm handheld into an 
Ical\-formatted calendar. Note, this is not the same as the iCal calendar 
format.


.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBread\-ical\fR [\fB\-p\fR <\fIport\fR>] <filename>


.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBread\-ical\fR allows the user to retrieve the contents of the ToDo and 
Datebook databases on a Palm handheld, and convert their contents to an Ical 
calendar.

Note that the calendar file named by <\fIfilename\fR> will be deleted, so do 
not use your main calendar. Instead, use a separate one for this purpose, and 
include it in your main calendar.

As \fBread\-ical\fR works by passing a script to ical, the ical application 
must be in your $PATH.


.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-port\fR <\fIport\fR>
Use device file <\fIport\fR> to communicate with the Palm handheld. If this 
is not specified, will look for the \fI$PILOTPORT\fR environment variable. 
If both are not found, will fall back to /dev/pilot.

.SH "USAGE"

databases (ToDoDB.pdb and DatebookDB.pdb respectively), then instruct 
\fIical\fR to write a calendar file based on the retrieved information.
