.SH "NAME"
\fBinstall\-datebook\fR \- installs a new datebook entry onto your Palm 
handheld.


.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBinstall\-datebook\fR [\fB\-p\fR <\fIport\fR>] \-r [<\fIfilename\fR> ...]
.LP 

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBinstall\-datebook\fR allows the user to create one or more datebook entries from one or more source files. 
.LP 
The format of the source file contains one datebook entry per line, containing four tab separated fields. The fields are start date/time, end date/time, alarm settings, and the description of datebook entry. This program doesn't yet support repeated entries. The date and time must be in format understand by \fIparsedate.y\fR. At the very least, the following two formats are understood:
.IP 
August 11, 1997 0800 GMT+300

1997/08/11 08:22:33 GMT+300
.LP 
If either one of the date and time fields is empty, the entry is installed without time. If the alarm field is empty, the entry is installed without setting any alarms. The alarm field can contain numbers followed by "m" (minutes), "h" (hours), or "d" (days).

Here are some example lines ([__TAB__] = tab, [__NL__] = newline in these examples):
.IP 
1997/08/11 0800 GMT+300 [__TAB__] 1997/08/11 0900 GMT+300 [__TAB__] [__TAB__] IETF

If no timezone is given, \fBinstall\-datebook\fR will assume the time is in GMT and it will convert it to localtime. If you don't want to create timezone entries for all begin and end times, set the TZ environment variable to GMT before running this program.
