.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBaddresses\fR will connect to your Palm device and dump the current AddressDB.pdb entries to STDOUT (generally the screen) or, if redirected with the '>' character, it will redirect to a file of your choosing (called "MyAddresses.txt in this case, but may be called any other filename you wish).


.SH "OPTIONS"
There is only one option (and it is, well, optional), and that is the '>' redirection character to send the output to a file (or process) instead of STDOUT (generally "The Screen[tm]")
