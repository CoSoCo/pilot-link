.RP 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBaddresses\fR will connect to your Palm handheld and dump all entries found in the AddressDB.pdb (Address Book) file to STDOUT (generally the screen) or, if redirected with the '>' (greater-than) character, it will redirect to a file of your choosing (called "MyAddresses.txt in the above example, but may be called any other filename you wish).


.SH "OPTIONS"
There is only one option (and it is, well, optional), and that is the '>' redirection character to send the output to a file (or process) instead of STDOUT (generally "The Screen[tm]")


.SH "USAGE"
The program will read Address data from the Palm handheld and output a format suitable for the other programs to import as required. You may redirect the output to a file or process, at your choosing.

\fBaddresses\fR [\fB\-p\fR <\fIport\fR>] > MyAddresses.txt   # redirect to a file (or process/pipe)
.br
\fBaddresses\fR [\fB\-p\fR <\fIport\fR>]                     # print to STDOUT/the screen
