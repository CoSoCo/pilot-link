.SH "NAME"
\fBpilot\-archive\fR \- Prints "Archived" records from ToDoDB.pdb to STDOUT


.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBpilot\-archive\fR [\fB\-p\fR <\fIport\fR>]


.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBpilot\-archive\fR is used to print records marked as "Archive to Desktop"
on your Palm handheld to a generic CSV format, which can be used to create
"archive" files on the desktop, if you choose to do so.

When you delete data on your Palm device, whether it in in the Datebook or
ToDo or other application, the Palm will prompt you to "archive" these
deleted records.  With \fBpilot\-archive\fR, you can store and maintain
those deleted records, if you wish.


.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-port\fR <\fIport\fR>
Use device file <\fIport\fR> to communicate with the Palm handheld.
If this is not specified, will look for the \fI$PILOTPORT\fR environment
variable. If both are not found or supplied, \fBinstall\-expenses\fR will
fall back to /dev/pilot

.SH "USAGE"
Connect to a target Palm handheld and return the "archived" (deleted)
records in your ToDo database in a common, generic CSV format, which can be
used to create "archive" files on the desktop.

\fBpilot\-archive\fR only speaks to the ToDoDB.pdb file at this time, but
adding support for the other applications is very trivial. Just look at the
code and add your database connection as required.


.SH "EXAMPLES"
To output the "deleted" items on your Palm handheld into CSV format with
\fBpilot\-archive\fR, simply supply the port option to \fBpilot\-archive\fR 
and connect to your Palm device as follows: 
.IP 
\fBpilot\-archive\fR \fB\-p\fR /dev/pilot
.LP

\fBpilot\-archive\fR will connect to your Palm device, and output something
similar to the following:
.IP
"Category", "Technology", "Priority", "1", "Completed", "No", "Due", 
"Sat Dec 20 00:00:00 2003 ", "Description", "Mail expense forms to work", 
"Note", "",
