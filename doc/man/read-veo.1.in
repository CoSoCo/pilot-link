\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\fR
List picture information found on the Palm handheld instead of converting
the entries found to image files.


.SH "USAGE"
The program will connect to the target Palm handheld, and read the images
found in the Veo Traveler image databases, and allow the user to view the
list of images or to convert all of them to Portable Pixmap (.ppm) files to
be viewed or printed at the desktop. If no options are specified, all of the
images on the device will be converted to ppm files by default.

\fBKNOWN BUGS\fR
.IP
\fBread\-veo\fR does no colour correction or intensity adjustment. A simple
step to improve the look of colours is to do a histogram equalization in
your favourite image editor. This may get added in the future.
