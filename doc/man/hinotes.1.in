.SH "NAME"
\fBhinotes\fR \- Syncronize your Hi\-Notes database with your desktop machine


.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBhinotes\fR [\fB\-p\fR <\fIport\fR>] [\fIoptions\fR]


.SH "DESCRIPTION"
By default, the contents of your Palm's memo database will be written to
STDOUT as a standard Unix mailbox (in mbox\-format) file, with each memo as a
separate message. The subject of each message will be set as the category.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 
\fB\-d\fR <\fIdir\fR>
Stores the memos in subdirectories of 
<\fIdir\fR. Each subdirectory will contain the name of a category on the Palm where the record was stored, and will contain the memos found in that category.

Each memo's filename will be the first line (up to the first 40 characters) of the memo. Control characters, slashes, and equal signs ('=') that would otherwise appear in filenames are converted using the correct MIME's quoted\-printable encoding methods.


.SH "USAGE"
The program will dump your MemoPad database (MemoDB.pdb) from the Palm and
output format suitable for the \fIHi\-Notes\fR application to use.
