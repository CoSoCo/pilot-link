.SH "NAME"
\fBinstall\-memo\fR \- installs a new memo entry onto your Palm Computing Device


.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBinstall\-memo\fR [\fB\-p\fR <\fIport\fR>]
[\fB\-rt\fR] [\fB\-c\fR <\fIcategory\fR>] [<\fIfilename\fR> ...]


.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBinstall\-memo\fR allows the user to write one or more files as a new memo or memos,
respectively, onto the Palm handheld device.


.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-port\fR <\fIport\fR>
Use device file lt;\fIport\fR> to communicate with the Palm handheld device. If this is not specified, will look for the \fI$PILOTPORT\fR environment variable. If both are not found, will fall back to /dev/pilot.
   
   
.TP 
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display help synopsis for \fBinstall\-memo\fR


.TP 
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Display version of \fBinstall\-memo\fR


.TP 
\fB\-c\fR, <\fIcategory\fR>
Install memo(s) to category defined by <\fIcategory\fR> by default. Normally 
\fBinstall\-memo\fR uses the \fIUnfiled\fR category as the default category if no category is chosen. 


.TP 
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-replace\fR
Replace all memos in the category specified by the \fB\-c\fR <\fIcategory\fR>
option.


.TP 
\fB\-t\fR
Use the filename as the title for the memo. (Normally, the title is the first line of 
a memo if \fB\-t\fR is not specified.)


.SH "USAGE"
The program will connect to the Palm handheld device, and write the file or
files given on the command line into the MemoPad application on the Palm.


.SH "KNOWN BUGS"
The Palm Device has a maximum length of 4,096 bytes (4k) on memopad entries, if you wish to retain the ability to edit the Memo on the Palm itself. You can create a MemoPad entry of 65,490 bytes in size (the absolute maximum) if you do not need to edit the Memo entry further on the Palm device itself.

This is not specifically a "bug", but a limitation in the PalmOS design itself.
