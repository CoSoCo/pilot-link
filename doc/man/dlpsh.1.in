.SH "NAME"
\fBdlpsh\fR is a command "shell" for executing DLP (Desktop Link Protocol) commands to a Palm handheld.


.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBdlpsh\fR [\fB\-p\fR <port>]


.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBdlpsh\fR allows the user to connect to a Palm handheld and execute arbitrary DLP commands. Once connected, the user may execute most of the built\-in \fBDLP\fR commands. (See \fBBUILT\-IN COMMANDS\fR below for more detail on currently supported options).

.br 
The connection to the Pilot is kept alive by sending a
\fIPadTickle\fR packet to the Pilot after a small period of non\-activity. (7 seconds by default)


.SH "BUILT\-IN COMMANDS"
There are many options available while connected to your Palm handheld via \fBdlpsh\fR, including the following. 

.TP 
\fBuser\fR
Print the currently set User information, including Username, UserID, PCid, and ViewerID. You may also set these values from this command as well. Use 'user --help' while connected to see details on how to set or change these values.

.TP 
\fBls\fR
Used with \-l and \-r to provide long and RAM and ROM file lists, similar to the Unix 'ls' command. This does not yet allow you to narrow your listing to a certain range of files. It will simply list them all.

.TP 
\fBdf\fR
Display how much RAM and ROM is free on your device, again similar to the Unix 'df' command. This does not accept arguments at this time.

.TP 
\fBtime\fR
Set the time on the Palm from the currently-set desktop time. This does not work on OS version 3.3, due to a bug in PalmOS at that time. 

.TP 
\fBrm\fR
Remove a file and delete it entirely from the Palm device. This is an irrevokable process, and you cannot "undelete" a file, once it has been deleted with this command.

.TP 
\fBquit\fR
Exit the DLP Protocol Shell


.SH "OPTIONS"
While in \fBdlpsh\fR, you can always invoke 'help' or <option> \-\-help to get further information on that option.


.SH "USAGE"
The program will connect to your Palm handheld and give the user an interactive prompt (a "shell") for executing commands across the DLP \fIHotSync\fR protocol.
