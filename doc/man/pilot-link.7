.TH PILOT-LINK 7 "3Com Pilot Tools" "FSF" \" -*- nroff -*-
.SH NAME
pilot-link \- a suite of tools for communicating with Palm Computing, Inc. 
Palm Devices as well as the Handspring Visor, TRGPro, and other devices 
which conform to this standard (PalmOS licensed devices).
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B pilot-link
suite of tools contains a series of conduits for moving information to and from
your Palm device and your desktop or workstation system.
.SH TARGET DEVICE
All of the
.B pilot-link
programs will default to
.B /dev/pilot
as the default serial device used to communicate with a Palm.
In general, if the environment variable
.B $PILOTPORT
is set, its value will override the default.
A serial device specified on the command-line will be used regardless of any
$PILOTPORT setting.
.PP
The default connection rate is 9600 baud.
You are welcome to try higher baud rates (19200, 38400, 57600 or higher) by setting the
.B $PILOTRATE
environment variable, but various machines have various limitations.
(Be careful about values higher than 115200 on Linux boxes if you've been using 
setserial to change the multiplier.)
