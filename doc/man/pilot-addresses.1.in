\fBpilot\-addresses\fR [\fIcommon-options\fR] \fB\-\-delete\-all\fR


.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBpilot\-addresses\fR allows the user to read all entries in the Palm
Address Book application, write new entries into the database, and delete a
category or delete all entries in the database.


.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 
See \fBpilot-link\fR(7) for details on the common options.



.TP 
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-augment\fR
Augments fields in address book records with additional information.  The
augmented information is placed before and separated from the field with a
semi\-colon, (;). 
Empty fields are not augmented.

Augmented information can include any of the following below. 

<\fIcategory\fR><\fIshown\-phone\fR> Placed in front of each
entry with a category set or with shown\-phone set.

<\fIphone\-label\fR> Placed in front of each phone number field. 
These are drawn from the labels set on the Palm device, typically:

["Work"|"Home"|"Fax"|"Other"|"E\-mail"|"Main"|"Pager"|"Mobile"]

\fBNote:\fR This produces a non\-standard CSV file which is
not parseable by anything other than \fBpilot\-addresses\fR.


.TP 
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-category\fR <\fIcategory\fR>
Install records to category <\fIcategory\fR> by default. Normally
\fBpilot\-addresses\fR uses the \fIUnfiled\fR category by default. This
option is overridden by the category specified in the record with the
\fB\-a\fR option.

.TP 
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-tdelim\fR <\fIdelim\fR>
Use the delimiter specified to separate all
fields of a record. Delimiters are specified as follows: 3=tab, 
2=; (semi\-colon), 1=, (comma), 0=\\n (newline).
This overrides the default delimiter of comma between fields and semi\-colon
between a field's augmented information. 

\fBNote:\fR This may generate
confusing results when used with the \fB\-a\fR option.
This generates non\-standard CSV files, which may be
unparseable by anything other than \fBpilot\-addresses\fR.


.TP 
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-delete\-category\fR <\fIcategory\fR>

Delete all records in the specified category <\fIcategory\fR> and do nothing else.


.TP 
\fB\-\-delete-all\fR
Delete all address book records in all categories. Obviously, be \fBvery\fR
careful with this one.



.TP 
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-read\fR <\fIfile\fR>
Reads records from <\fIfile\fR> and install them to the Palm Address Book
application. (Use the \fB\-w\fR <\fIfile\fR> option to get a sample
"template file" for input records to see how the fields are laid out).




.TP 
\fB\-w\fR, \-\-write <\fIfile\fR>
Reads all address book records from the Palm Address Book application and writes
them into <\fIfile\fR>


.SH "USAGE"
The program will connect to the Palm handheld, and perform the requested
read or write operation specified by the user.
