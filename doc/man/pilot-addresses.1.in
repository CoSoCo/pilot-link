.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBpilot\-addresses\fR [\fB\-p\fR <\fIport\fR>] [\fB\-c\fR <\fIcategory\fR>] [\fB\-d\fR <\fIcategory\fR>] [\fB\-r\fR <\fIfile\fR> | \fB\-w\fR <\fIfile\fR>] 

(Note that not all available options are shown above)


.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBpilot\-addresses\fR allows the user to read all entries in the Palm
Address Book application, write new entries into the database, and delete a
category or delete all entries in the database.


.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-port\fR <\fIport\fR>
Use device file <\fIport\fR> to communicate with the Palm handheld.
If this is not specified, will look for the \fI$PILOTPORT\fR environment
variable. If both are not found or supplied, \fBinstall\-expenses\fR will
fall back to /dev/pilot.


.TP 
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR   
Display the help synopsis for \fBpilot\-addresses\fR.


.TP 
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Display version of \fBpilot\-addresses\fR.


.TP 
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-augment\fR
Augments fields in address book records with additional information.  The
augmented information is placed before and separated from the field with a
semi\-colon, (;).

Augmented information can include any of the following below. 

<\fIcategory\fR>  # Placed in front of each record or..

Placed in front of each phone number field: 

["Work"|"Home"|"Fax"|"Other"|"E\-mail"|"Main"|"Pager"|"Mobile"]

Empty fields are not augmented.


.TP 
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-category\fR <\fIcategory\fR>
Install records to category <\fIcategory\fR> by default. Normally
\fBpilot\-addresses\fR uses the \fIUnfiled\fR category by default. This
option is overridden by the category specified in the record with the
\fB\-a\fR option.


.TP 
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-delcat\fR <\fIcategory\fR>

Delete all records in the specified category <\fIcategory\fR> before installing new records.


.TP 
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-delall\fR
Delete all address book records in all categories. Obviously, be \fBvery\fR
careful with this one.


.TP 
.B \fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-escape\fR
Escape all special characters with a backslash. This enables you to read and
write entries with newline characters in a field or note.


.TP 
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-read\fR <\fIfile\fR>
Reads records from <\fIfile\fR> and install them to the Palm Address Book
application. (Use the \fB\-w\fR <\fIfile\fR> option to get a sample
"template file" for input records to see how the fields are laid out).


.TP 
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-tdelim\fR <\fIdelim\fR>
Include category in each record, use the delimiter specified to separate all
fields of a record. Delimiters are specified as follows: 3=tab, 2=;, 1=,.
This overrides the default delimiter of comma between fields and semi\-colon
between a field's augmented information. (Please note that this may generate
confusing results when used with the \fB\-a\fR option.)


.TP 
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-titles\fR
Write a header line with field titles as the first line of the data file.


.TP 
\fB\-w\fR, \-\-write <\fIfile\fR>
Reads all address book records from the Palm Address Book application and writes
them into <\fIfile\fR>
