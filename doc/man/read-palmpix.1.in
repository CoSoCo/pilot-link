.SH "USAGE"
The program will connect to the target Palm handheld, and read the images
found in the Kodak PalmPix image database (\fIArchImage.pdb\fR), and allow
the user to view the list of images and image details, or to select one or
all of them, and convert them to Portable Network Graphic (.png) or Portable
Pixmap (.ppm) files to be viewed or printed at the desktop. If no options
are specified, all of the images on the device will be converted to ppm
files by default.
