or Portable Pixmap (.ppm) files on their system.


.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-port\fR <\fIport\fR>
Use device file <\fIport\fR> to communicate with the Palm handheld.
If this is not specified, will look for the \fI$PILOTPORT\fR environment
variable. If both are not found or supplied, \fBinstall\-expenses\fR will

.TP 
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\fR
List picture information found on the Palm handheld instead of converting
the entries found to image files.


.TP 
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-name\fR <\fIpixname\fR> 
Convert only \fIpixname\fR to an image file, and output to a .ppm or .png.

\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-type\fR <\fItype\fR>
Specify the output picture type. Can be either "png" or "ppm".


.SH "USAGE"
The program will connect to the target Palm handheld, and read the images
found in the Kodak PalmPix image database (\fIArchImage.pdb\fR), and allow
the user to view the list of images and image details, or to select one or
all of them, and convert them to Portable Network Graphic (.png) or Portable
Pixmap (.ppm) files to be viewed or printed at the desktop. If no options
are specified, all of the images on the device will be converted to ppm
files by default.


.SH "BUGS"
.PP
\fBKNOWN BUGS\fR
.IP
\fBread\-palmpix\fR's colour correction is not yet as good as Kodak's own,
but Kodak has deprecated the PalmPix device, so it is not likely that there
will be any updates to their software in the future, so this may be as good
as it gets.
