pilot-link automated documentation conversion
**The manpage files are generated automatically**
**Only edit the files in this xml/ directory!**

==============================

The pilot-link.docbook should only be edited directly when
adding or removing subpages from the documentation.

Documentation generation:
=========================

To generate new documentation after modifying files in
xml/, just use make.

Pilot-link customisations:
==========================

Pilot-link uses a customised manpage XSL stylesheet for
aesthetic reasons only. Other stylesheets can be used
for other outputs, as long as the installed manpages
use the customised XSL.

The Makefile process uses sed to set the directory paths and
value of the VERSION variable and then writes out the manpages
using xsltproc -o ../man/ <pathtoXSL> pilot-link.docbook
