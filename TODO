	* Fix the C++ test(s) in ./configure, and roll all of this
	  back into autogen.sh/automake scripts. 

        * Clean up pilot-xfer a bit more, add a -ntp <palm|desktop>
          option to sync the time from/to the desktop from/to the Palm.

        * Start to condense the install-* binaries into one binary
          called pilot-install.

        * Review pilot-mail. Do we need this? Can we depricate this, and
          begin the transition over to Hollis' work on pilot-mailsync?  

        * Deal with the m100 API to Notepad. Has anyone taken a look at
          the data structures and come up with a way we can replicate
          them, to read records? Ideally the images should be
          $(NAME).png, and the text associated with it should be
          $(NAME).txt.

        * Manpages manpages manpages. Online documentation would be nice
          too, but that can come later.

        * Remove the pi_bind, pi_listen, pi_accept from all relevant
          files, and create a function pi_error() which will return the
          proper responses. Additionally, remove PalmHeader() and stick
          that in it's own function which will report --version calls.

        * Add progress callbacks to libpisock so that you can find out
          how far a file transfer has gone (this is complex, as you also
          need to instrument PADP and perhaps SLP transmissions,
          receptions, and calculating exactly how many bytes is needed
          to transfer a file won't be fun.)

        * Check RPC code (something broken on large-endian machines?)

        * Add reada socket calls that allocate the return buffer
          (important for NetSync, as results larger then 64K are
          possible).

        * Fix DLP to understand multiple return arguments.

        * Write iambicExpense.c

        * Teach sync-plan about the other repetition types that are
          convertable from Plan to Pilot.

        * Add Tcl 8 specific code to allow retrieval of raw records, and
          optionally use Tcl routines for packing and unpacking.
             - Add all dlp functions.
             - Clean up the channel code rats nest. Somehow. (Separate
               source file?)

        * Perl bindings
             - Change record representation from string to object to
               match Python implementation.
             - Add packers.
             - Document.

        * Python binding:
             - Add packers.
             - Document.

	* Java code needs to be cleaned up. Any volunteers? I could
          learn this, but it would slow down releases.

	* pilot-xfer -f will only fetch pdb files.  There's no way to
          individually pluck a file (with a prc|PRC extension) from the
          Palm. pilot-schlep does it, but that binary should be
          depricated.

        * Should we nuke addresses from the package? The functionality
          it provides is already in pilot-addresses.

        * pilot-schlep should ideally be nuked as well, and the -f
          option of it rolled into pilot-xfer to provide the option
          above. (pilot-schlep /dev/irnine -f > ExtractedProg.prc)

	* Merge install-*.c into pilot-install. Too much duplicated code
          in there. Symlink the rest of the apps to pilot-install, and
          just test argv[0] to run the proper functions.

	* Need to clean up the OS/2 defines, or remove them entirely.  
          This requires that the ./configure be reversed into
          configure.in/auto* scripts. Not hard, just takes a bit of
          testing. We need this anyway, so we can rebuild configure as
          we add/remove options. The 'p4' stuff should be tweaked, and
          ${HOST} detected upon ./configure.

	* manpages. I know, nobody wants to do them, but we need to
          clearly document some of the obscure options that some of the
          pilot-link binaries offer (such as 'ls -l' in dlpsh). This
          also includes active examples of some of the complicated
          options.
