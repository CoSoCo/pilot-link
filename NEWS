Pilot-Link 0.10.99, "Woodstock", 03-20-2002
-------------------------------------------

This is a development release, primarily to test the new usb device support. 
Most of the USB devices are on /dev/ttyUSB1 (or usb/tts/1), except for the
Sony PEG-S300 and 760C which are on /dev/ttyUSB0 (or usb/tts/0).  Note that
you must hit the sync button prior to running the app right now for USB
devices.  It is recommended that a kernel > 2.4.16 be used due to problems
that existed in earlier drivers (may get a kernel oops).

Major Features:
	* Support for new USB devices (like the Palm m500 and Sony
	  PEG-N710C)
	* Updated Java bindings (David Goodenough)
	* Updated Python bindings (Rob Tillotson)
	* Application cleanup for consistency

Other Features:
	* Generic device and protocol implementations
	* Complete Autoconf/Automake setup
	* C++ library is now shared (.so) and installed
	* Complete source tree re-organization
	* Runtime debug logging down to the packet level

Bug Fixes:
	* Expense Preferences now pack/unpack correctly
	* Dozens of minor bug fixes, code reformatting, reordanization

Known Problems (Please see doc/TODO for more details):
	* os2serial.c and winserial.c files are not yet ported to the new
	  USB, serial, and Net protocol "recipes"
	* The "sys" protocol is not well tested
	* TCL/TK bindings are out of commission
	* PDB files with space filler records are not yet handled properly
