Pilot-Link 0.10.99.1, "Altamont", 06-28-2002
--------------------------------------------

This is a development release, primarily to test the new usb device support. 
Most of the USB devices are on /dev/ttyUSB1 (or usb/tts/1), except for the
Sony PEG-S300 and 760C which are on /dev/ttyUSB0 (or usb/tts/0).  Note that
you must hit the sync button prior to running the app right now for USB
devices.  It is recommended that a kernel > 2.4.16 be used due to problems
that existed in earlier drivers (may get a kernel oops).

Major Features:
	* DLP argument parsing re-write
	* Better usb device support e.g. usb:/dev/ttyUSB1 
	
Other Features:
	* Allow sync to proceed even if OS 4.x device has password set
	* Split out generic conduit library to libpisync
	* DLP regression test

Bug Fixes:
	* Compile perl, python modules with correct lib dir
	* Lots of minor bug fixes, reorganization

Known Problems (Please see doc/TODO for more details):
	* os2serial.c and winserial.c files are not yet ported to the new
	  USB, serial, and Net protocol "recipes"
	* The "sys" protocol is not well tested
	* TCL/TK bindings are out of commission
	* PDB files with space filler records are not yet handled properly
