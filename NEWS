Pilot-Link 0.11.1, "Ocean's Eleven", 07-18-2002
-----------------------------------------------

This is a minor bugfix release to squish some of the bugs that creeped in
under the door into the 0.11 release. Most notably: 
	
	User Updates
	------------
	- pilot-xfer -f didn't work at all in 0.11, fixed. 
	- pilot-xfer -f bugfix for non-writable local files 
	- read-palmpix now takes arguments for output file type, '-t png' or
	  '-t ppm'
	- read-notepad also updated to accept the same argument types

	Development Updates
	-------------------
	- All of the language bindings (Perl, Python, Java, Tcl, Tk, iTcl)
	  all default to off, unless specified. If you want to enable them,
	  you must use --with-foo, where 'foo' is the binding of your
	  choice, such as --with-perl
	- Fixed some of the gcc-related warnings (more to come)
	- Minor Python build fix

	ToDo List for 0.11.2
	--------------------
	User Updates
	------------
	- pilot-addresses -T header fix (don't import header into record)
	- pilot-xfer -f fix (support '-f FooDB' as 'FooDB.p{db|rc|qa}
	- pxd, first cut at a pilot-xfer'ized daemon
	- missing manpages corrected
	- pilot-datebook updated to match remaining structure

	Development Updates
	-------------------
	- Fix all remaining -pedantic warnings and errors Update
	- configure.in to handle testing for python-devel installed
	  #include <Python.h> int main() {PyObject x; return 0;}
	- Update Java bindings to use Ant instead of {g|n}make 
	- Rewrite Perl bindings to take advantage of MakeMaker 
	- Add missing DLP 1.2 calls


Pilot-Link 0.11, "Ocean's Eleven", 07-12-2002
---------------------------------------------

This is a development release, primarily to test the new usb device support. 
Most of the USB devices are on /dev/ttyUSB1 (or usb/tts/1), except for the
Sony PEG-S300 and 760C which are on /dev/ttyUSB0 (or usb/tts/0).  Note that
you must hit the sync button prior to running the app right now for USB
devices.  It is recommended that a kernel > 2.4.16 be used due to problems
that existed in earlier drivers (may get a kernel oops).

Major Features:
	* DLP argument parsing re-write
	* Better usb device support e.g. usb:/dev/ttyUSB1 
	
Other Features:
	* Allow sync to proceed even if OS 4.x device has password set
	* Split out generic conduit library to libpisync
	* DLP regression test

Bug Fixes:
	* Compile perl, python modules with correct lib dir
	* Lots of minor bug fixes, reorganization

Known Problems (Please see doc/TODO for more details):
	* os2serial.c and winserial.c files are not yet ported to the new
	  USB, serial, and Net protocol "recipes"
	* The "sys" protocol is not well tested
	* TCL/TK bindings are out of commission
	* PDB files with space filler records are not yet handled properly
