Pilot-Link 0.10.99, "Woodstock", 03-20-2002
-------------------------------------------

This is a development release, primarily to test the new usb device
support.  Most of the USB devices are on /dev/ttyUSB1 (or usb/tts/1),
except for the Sony PEG-S300 and 760C which are on /dev/ttyUSB0 (or
usb/tts/0).  Note that you must hit the sync button prior to running
the app right now for USB devices.  It is recommended that a kernel >
2.4.16 be used due to problems that existed in earlier drivers (may
get a kernel oops).

Major Features:

	* Support for new USB devices (like the m500)
	* Updated Java and Python bindings
	* Application cleanup for consistency

Other Features:

	* Generic device and protocol implementations
	* Complete Autoconf/Automake setup
