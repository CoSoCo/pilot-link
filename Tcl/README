This is an experimental piece of code to bind the pilot-link library to Tcl.
You must have tcl 8.0b1 installed, and you'll need to figure out how to
properly build a dynamically loadable library (if that is even possible).
The included Makefile is only likely to work on ELF systems.

Currently only a very few commands are bound. test.tcl demonstrates them.
