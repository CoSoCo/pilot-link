Dec 30, 1996	Kenneth Albanowski 0.4.1

	Got sync-ical functional. It's very messy, but parts of it do actually
	   work.
	Added new trace code to lib/dlp. Enable with -DDLP_TRACE in makefile.
	Added remaining DLP functions. All but RPC are now implemented (and I
	   have not been able to deduce how to invoke RPC under DLP, so it
	   will stay unimplemented until somebody comes up with more information.)
	Pace's patch for dlp_ReadRecordIDList.
	Added patch to pi-file to successfully store zero-length records.
	_Also_ added patch to stop ignore records on database retrieval that
	   are archived or deleted. The reason is that without going to the
	   RPC layer, there is no way to store records with those attributes.
	Mucked about with getopt in pilot-xfer, hopefully for the better.
	Added uname detection to configure so that IRIX gets proper warning flag.
	
	-- sync code still in limbo, undoubtedly not helped by holiday season.
	   Patience is a virtue.

Dec 22, 1996    Kenneth Albanowski 0.4.0

    Removed {install,retrieve}-{pdb,prc} packages, replaced with
       pilot-xfer, which also includes general backup and listing functions. 
    Integrated Pace Willisson's pi-file code, replacing prc.c & pdb.c. (This
       new code, along with pilot-xfer, is intended to be production
       quality, and should be used as the basis for all attempts to
       manipulate Pilot files, as well as the stock mechanism for backing
       up a Pilot via Unix.)
    Added Pace's pdump, modified and renamed to pilot-file, which is used for
      dumping and exploring .pdb and .prc files.
    Wrote and tested sync.c abstract synchronization layer. All but category
      synchronization and the detail of when to use which sync type is implemented.
    Fleshed out sync-memodir program which can now successfully synchronize a
      Pilot with a "memo directory", a directory containing text files.
    (sync-ical is still useless stub)
    Integrated Bill Sommerfeld's patches for read-ical, padp, and syspkt.
    
    -- Removed sync code based on Palm algorithms, pending approval from
       Palm/USR. What remains is sufficient to overwrite one side with
       another, and to serve as a framework if people who have not seen Palm
       code want to implement their own algorithms.
       
       Quoting from lib/sync.c:
       
       * Revised revision: all sections of code directly derived (albeit in a
       * paraphased manner) from code in the Palm Conduit SDK, _which are not
       * blatently obvious and irreducible_ have been temporarily removed until
       * word is obtained from Palm that the code may be publically released.
       *
       * The issue that needs to be resolved is whether Palm Computing Inc. will
       * allow the public distribution of source code derived from source code in
       * their Pilot PC Conduit SDK. The licensing information that I recieved
       * with the PC and Mac SDKs is not sufficient to resolve this question.
       *
       * In keeping with the sprit of the EU practice for reverse engineering, the
       * interface that I have designed to plug into the Palm algorithms has been
       * retained.

Dec 10, 1996	Kenneth Albanowski 0.3.3

    Added dlp_DeletedRecord, dlp_DeletedResource, and dlp_ReadRecordIDList.
    Pausing problems on some machines (other then Linux) still unsolved.
    Added 'ls' command to dlpsh.

Dec 1, 1996		Kenneth Albanowski 0.3.2

    Converted package to use autoconf for configuration.

    Added install-pdb, retrieve-prc, and retrieve-pdb.
    Added read-ical, which converts the Pilot's datebook and todo list
      into an Ical 2.x calendar.
    Renamed todos to read-todos to avoid conflict with common utility.
    Added Robert A. Kaplan's install-todos (slightly modified and renamed.)
    Got rid of CBAUD and memmove, defined ENOMSG if not present.

      - AppInfo block support for all Pilot applications
      - new "addresses" end user program
      - new "todos" end user program

	  - cleanup of "system packets"
	  - new "memo" end user program
	  - new "remind" end user program

	accept() now blocks insted of listen().  DJD.
