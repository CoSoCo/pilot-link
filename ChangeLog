Jun 1, 1997 	Kenneth Albanowski 0.6.5
	Patches for OS/2 supplied by Mike Jarabek <jarabemj@mcmail.CIS.McMaster.CA>.

May 25, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.6.4

	Added pi_watchdog function to automatically tickle sockets.
	Modified dlpsh to use watchdog.
	Added get_s/set_s macros to manipulate signed Pilot values. The old routines
		are now officially unsigned.
	Modified get/set float routines to use signed macros.
	Added scripts/struct.pl, a first attempt at a portable structure preprocessor.
	Modified libsock/dlp.c to use struct.pl for ReadStorageInfo.

May 18, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.6.3

    Serial code uses PILOTPORT environment variable if a port isn't specified (but
    	note that the included utilities do not yet make use of this.)
	Perl 5 module now supports GetAppPref and SetAppPref functions (only the
		former is tested.)
	Removed 'bool' from Perl 5 code.
	Python SetAppPref function modified to match Perl calling sequence.
	Added RPC calls to Python interface (check out test.py).
	Revised various DLP functions to check for overlarge input buffers.
	New C++ code revision.

May 11, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.6.2

    Added pilot-undelete utility to un-archive records. Needs Perl 5.
	Added pilot-clip to retrieve (can not yet set) the pilot's clipboard.
	Repaired Python SetRecord and SetResource, which were broken.
	Added Unpack, Pack, PackAppBlock & UnpackAppBlock methods to Python DLP
	    object. (These automatically route to MemoUnpack, TodoUnpack, etc.)
	Removed all bool, true, & false from C++ code.
	If Perl 5 is around, use the flags it calculated for dynamically loadable code
	    to render the libraries position independant. (Experimental/hack.)
	Perl and Python examples now prompt for serial port.

Mar 4, 1997 	Kenneth Albanowski 0.6.1

	Perl5 support nearly complete. Documentation less so.
	Python support nearly complete. Documentation less so.
    Scott's C++ and uchar_t cleanup.
	DLP ResetDBIndex now resets emulated category iterator.
	Fixed lib/serial variable definition. Really.
	Fixed long-standing bug in terminating card manufacturer's name.
	Fixed socket code leaking file descriptors and double closing.
	Modified socket code to return separate fd from pi_accept().
	Added suffixes and .cc definition to makefiles.
	Applied Mark Eichin's <eichin@cygnus.com> configure and makefile
	    portability patches.
	Applied David Warren's <dsw@comfortably-numb.asd.sgi.com> makefile and
	    socket portability patches.

Apr 28, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.6.0

	Primary feature: optional C++ support. If you have a C++ compiler, you'll
	   get new code, and a new library.
    Added Scott Grosch's <grosch@ichips.intel.com> C++ code, and completely
       mucked up autoconf getting it to understand optional C++ code.
	Paul Traina's <pst@Shockwave.COM> patches for pilot-mail's use of getopt.
    Fixed simple variable definition problem affecting SGTYY in serial.c
    Fixed lib/Makefile trailing slash and object duplication.
    Added pd-tty.c to break out tty/async display code from pilot-debug.
    Added GNU readline 2.0 support to pilot-debug (see Makefile).
    Added complete Pilot Expense application DB support.
    Added read-expenses program to document expenses reading.
    Modified lib/pi-file so it will not even attempt to install deleted records
       (even if the DB contains them) on an old Pilot, but will retrieve
       them if possible.

Apr 20, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.5.7
	
	Adaption for NeXTStep and Solaris configuration problems.
	  - Always use three arguments to fcntl.
	  - Use bmove for memmove even if memcopy is present.

Apr 13, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.5.6

    New pilot-mail excutable to directly support transmission and reception
       of internet mail through the Pilot Mail application present on newer
       Pilots. (Requires POP3 for reception and/or sendmail for transmission.)
    Fixed nasty bug in "long" DLP argument recognition. Please do not use 0.5.5.
    PalmOS 2.0 DLP functions DeleteCategory, ReadNextModifiedInCategory,
       ReadNextRecInCategory, ReadFeature, ReadAppPreference and
       WriteAppPreference are now emulated for 1.0 Pilots, and may be freely
       used where you like, regardless of OS version. (Untested)
    PalmOS 2.0 DLP functions repaired. (None would have worked in 0.5.5)
    Removed extraneous category parameter from dlp_ReadNext*Category functions.
    Added DLP function dlp_RPC, which allows invoking arbitrary system traps
       during HotSync.
    Fixed pilot-debug mirroring to display entire updated rectangle.
    Fixed uncaught decoding problem in unpack_ToDoAppInfo.
    DLP trace is now compiled in by default, but only activated if the
       PILOTDLP environment variable exists.

Apr 4, 1997		Kenneth Albanowski 0.5.5

    Added Ron Nicholson's <rhn@waltz.engr.sgi.com> patch for user-id setting
        in install-user.
    Added Jason S Kohles's <robobob@xmission.com> patch for excluding databases
        in pilot-xfer.
    Added pilot-schlep utility that allows you to carry a single UNIX file
        on your Pilot.
    Pilot-debug now can receive, display, enable, and disable screen updates. 
        (Type "mirror", then show the Remote UI window, and play with the Pilot.)
    Modified socket code to provide real descriptors from pi_socket that
        last through the bind, so they are directly selectable.
    Serial trace is now compiled in by default, but only activated
        if the PILOTLOG environment variable exists. (PILOTLOGFILE sets name.)
    Fixed baud-rate over 9600 "problem". (Mea culpa, I had commented out a
        call for testing purposes. My apologies.)
    Fixed rbuf leak in lib/pi-file.c. (Thanks to Scott Grosch for noticing.)
    With the gracious help of Palm, the following PalmOS 2.0 features are
       supported (though not yet tested):
    Updated CMP logic to match 2.0 versioning (extended CMP still to-do).
    Updated DLP decoding to decode long args (buffering and encoding rewrite to-do).
    Added v2.0 ReadFeature, DeleteCategory, ReadNextRecInCategory,  
        ReadNextModifiedRecInCategory, ReadAppPreference and WriteAppPreference
        DLP functions. (emulation for 1.0 Pilots to-do).
    Added v2.0 ReadNetSyncInfo and WriteNetSyncInfo functions (no 1.0 emulation
        possible.)
    Added v2.0 extension for CallApplication DLP function. (still works on 1.0)

Mar 22, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.5.4
	
	Added installation (and uninstallation) support to Makefile.
	Extensively reorganized pilot-debug startup, added Tcl event loop from
	    plus-patch, and removed Tk dependancy -- pilot-debug is now usable
	    with or without Tk! That means debugsh is officially deprecated,
	    unless there is a significant outcry for a Tcl-less debugger. 
	Modified syspkt RPC code to properly support byte values and pointers. 
	Added initial support for Personal PalmPilot -- but beware the
	    possibility of uncaught incompatibilities.
	Updated debugging routines in syspkt to more closely match Palm
	    documentation -- note that this breaks my original gdb patch.

Mar  9, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.5.3

	To help gdb, expanded syspkt support.
	Started reorganization of pilot-debug.

Mar  2, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.5.2

	Added Pilot-debug executable -- you'll need to modify Makefile to
	    compile it, read README for further instructions.
	Removed Linux DTR & RTS code, as per Ted Ts'o's request.
	Added Matthew Schnee's latest OS/2 patches.
	Changed default connection rate to 9600 from 19200. (For some reason
	    19200 now doesn't seem to be working on my machine. I have no
	    idea where the problem lies, hardware or software.)
	Modified lib/serial code (both UNIX and OS/2 sections) to use timeouts
	    specified in tenth seconds, allowing finer grained timeouts. This is
	    specifically used in the syspkt code to respond faster to RPC
	    failures.
	Modified lib/syspkt.c and include/pi-syspkt.h extensively to support
	    pilot-debug. This includes new packet transmission routines and
	    more modular RPC code.
	Added hack fix for deletion problem in pilot-addresses.
	
Feb 23, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.5.1

	Added getrom executable, and included getrom.prc from CoPilot
	    distribution with Greg Hewgill's permission.
	Completed data pack & unpack support for all Pilot applications.
	Modified headers and code (particularly dlp) to use new recordid_t
		typedef for record IDs. This should prevent one source of 
		sign problems.
	Modified dlp headers and code to pass all buffers as void*'s instead
	    of unsigned char *'s.
	Added experimental Perl5 linkage. To use, change to Perl5/PDAPilot
	    directory, run `perl Makefile.PL ; make test`, and stand back.
	    Most bits are currently missing and some bits don't work.

Feb  5, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.5.0

	Rearranged header files so they should be cleaner to externally use.
	Added pilot-dedupe program, which will automatically remove duplicate
		records from any Pilot database. (Use with caution on databases
		for third-party applications. It is safe to use on all of the
		standard databases.)
	Added useful serial trace. If SERIAL_TRACE is defined during
		compilation, then a complete trace of all serial activity (in and
		out) will be appended to PiDebug.log in the current directory. If
		you are getting low level failures of the software, please try
		generating one of these logs and mailing it to me
		(kjahds@kjahds.com) so I can attempt to find the problem.
	Made a few slight changes in various programs and headers to 
		reduce miscasts.
	Removed -Wall flag for CC compiler.

Jan 18, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.4.3

	Modified configure support for NeXT and OS/2.
	Added pilot-addresses program, a program designed to translate
		between a comma-separated-value format and the Pilot address book.
		In theory the format is compatible with the Palm Desktop
		import/export format. An "a" switch (Advanced/Augment) is available
		to output more data in a Desktop incompatible format.
		This software may be buggy! Always back up the DatebookDB database
		before installing records!
    Modified pilot-xfer to sort databases during Restore to put applications
        after their data, and larger records after smaller ones.
    Modified pilot-xfer to clear lastsyncpc value so that a fast sync will
        not be done with possibly missing sync flags on newly installed DBs.
	Added lib/address.c & addresses.c patches to simplify phone label storage. 
	Added -c switch to install-memo.c
	Added stub README.
	
Jan 9, 1997		Kenneth Albanowski 0.4.2

	Applied Pace's rm_fn patch, and pi-file patch for freads and attrs.
	My patch to return correct DLP errors.
	Probably some other stuff that I've forgotton.

Dec 30, 1996	Kenneth Albanowski 0.4.1

	Got sync-ical functional. It's very messy, but parts of it do actually
	   work.
	Added new trace code to lib/dlp. Enable with -DDLP_TRACE in makefile.
	Added remaining DLP functions. All but RPC are now implemented (and I
	   have not been able to deduce how to invoke RPC under DLP, so it
	   will stay unimplemented until somebody comes up with more information.)
	Pace's patch for dlp_ReadRecordIDList.
	Added patch to pi-file to successfully store zero-length records.
	_Also_ added patch to stop ignore records on database retrieval that
	   are archived or deleted. The reason is that without going to the
	   RPC layer, there is no way to store records with those attributes.
	Mucked about with getopt in pilot-xfer, hopefully for the better.
	Added uname detection to configure so that IRIX gets proper warning flag.
	
	-- sync code still in limbo, undoubtedly not helped by holiday season.
	   Patience is a virtue.

Dec 22, 1996    Kenneth Albanowski 0.4.0

    Removed {install,retrieve}-{pdb,prc} packages, replaced with
       pilot-xfer, which also includes general backup and listing functions. 
    Integrated Pace Willisson's pi-file code, replacing prc.c & pdb.c. (This
       new code, along with pilot-xfer, is intended to be production
       quality, and should be used as the basis for all attempts to
       manipulate Pilot files, as well as the stock mechanism for backing
       up a Pilot via Unix.)
    Added Pace's pdump, modified and renamed to pilot-file, which is used for
      dumping and exploring .pdb and .prc files.
    Wrote and tested sync.c abstract synchronization layer. All but category
      synchronization and the detail of when to use which sync type is implemented.
    Fleshed out sync-memodir program which can now successfully synchronize a
      Pilot with a "memo directory", a directory containing text files.
    (sync-ical is still useless stub)
    Integrated Bill Sommerfeld's patches for read-ical, padp, and syspkt.
    
    -- Removed sync code based on Palm algorithms, pending approval from
       Palm/USR. What remains is sufficient to overwrite one side with
       another, and to serve as a framework if people who have not seen Palm
       code want to implement their own algorithms.
       
       Quoting from lib/sync.c:
       
       * Revised revision: all sections of code directly derived (albeit in a
       * paraphased manner) from code in the Palm Conduit SDK, _which are not
       * blatently obvious and irreducible_ have been temporarily removed until
       * word is obtained from Palm that the code may be publically released.
       *
       * The issue that needs to be resolved is whether Palm Computing Inc. will
       * allow the public distribution of source code derived from source code in
       * their Pilot PC Conduit SDK. The licensing information that I recieved
       * with the PC and Mac SDKs is not sufficient to resolve this question.
       *
       * In keeping with the sprit of the EU practice for reverse engineering, the
       * interface that I have designed to plug into the Palm algorithms has been
       * retained.

Dec 10, 1996	Kenneth Albanowski 0.3.3

    Did more work on sync stuff, added sync-memodir.
    Added dlp_DeletedRecord, dlp_DeletedResource, and dlp_ReadRecordIDList.
    Pausing problems on some machines (other then Linux) still unsolved.
    Added 'ls' command to dlpsh.
    Turned 9600 limit back on for SGI.

Dec 1, 1996		Kenneth Albanowski 0.3.2

    Converted package to use autoconf for configuration.
    Cleaned up package so -Wall is clean.
    Added sync-ical stub. It does not do anything useful yet.

Nov 25, 1996    Kenneth Albanowski 0.3.1

    Integrated Ulrich Hertlein's SunOS patches (in slightly changed form).
    Integrated Matthew Schnee's final OS/2 patches (in slightly changed form).
    Added install-pdb, retrieve-prc, and retrieve-pdb.
    Added read-ical, which converts the Pilot's datebook and todo list
      into an Ical 2.x calendar.
    Renamed todos to read-todos to avoid conflict with common utility.
    Added Robert A. Kaplan's install-todos (slightly modified and renamed.)
    Got rid of CBAUD and memmove, defined ENOMSG if not present.
    Fixed PADP bug where unexpected packet in padp_rx would cause infinite loop.
